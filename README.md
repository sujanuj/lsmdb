# lsmdb

A log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) storage engine, built from scratch in Go.

This is a learning project, not a production database — the goal is to actually
implement the pieces that make engines like RocksDB, LevelDB, and Cassandra's storage
layer work, rather than depend on one.

## Status

**Phase 1 (current): Write-ahead log + crash recovery**

Every other piece of an LSM-tree — the memtable, SSTables, compaction — depends on
durability being correct first, so that's where this starts.

- [x] WAL record format with per-record checksums (CRC32)
- [x] Append-only writer with a configurable fsync policy
- [x] Replay logic that recovers all complete records and discards a trailing
      partial record (the signature of a crash mid-write) without treating it as
      a fatal error
- [x] Unit tests for encode/decode round-trips and checksum corruption
- [x] Truncation tests — verify replay behaves correctly no matter which exact
      byte the file is cut off at
- [x] A live kill-9 demo (`cmd/lsmdb-cli`) for actually watching recovery happen

**Planned:**

- [ ] Memtable (skip list, sorted, in-memory)
- [ ] SSTable file format + flush from memtable
- [ ] Bloom filters per SSTable
- [ ] Multi-level reads (memtable -> newest SSTable -> older SSTables)
- [ ] Compaction (size-tiered, to start)
- [ ] Concurrent reader/writer isolation
- [ ] Range scans (k-way merge iterator)
- [ ] Benchmark suite vs. SQLite and BoltDB

## Why a WAL first

The WAL is the durability boundary: a write isn't safe until it's recorded here.
Everything upstream (the memtable, the query layer) can be wrong in lots of small
ways and just produce a bug. If the WAL is wrong, you lose data permanently and
silently, which is a different category of problem — so it's worth getting this
layer right, with real tests, before building anything on top of it.

### On-disk record format

```
[4 bytes checksum][1 byte op][4 bytes key_len][4 bytes value_len][key][value]
```

The checksum covers everything after itself. On replay, a checksum mismatch or a
record that claims to be longer than the bytes actually remaining in the file is
treated as "this is the tail of an interrupted write" — replay stops there and
returns everything decoded so far as valid. This is deliberate: a half-written
record at the end of the file is the *expected* shape of a crash, not corruption
to panic over.

### Durability vs. throughput

`Log.Append` can fsync after every write (`SyncEveryWrite`) or leave syncing to
the caller (`SyncManual`). Every write that returns successfully under
`SyncEveryWrite` is guaranteed durable across a power loss, at the cost of a
disk round-trip per write. `SyncManual` is faster but means a crash can lose
writes since the last explicit `Sync()` call. This is the same tradeoff every
real WAL implementation (Postgres, RocksDB, etc.) exposes as a tunable -- there's
no setting that's "correct" independent of the workload's tolerance for loss vs.
its need for throughput.

## Proving crash recovery actually works

Two kinds of test exist for this:

**Synthetic (`internal/wal/crash_test.go`)** -- construct a WAL file by hand with
a deliberately truncated final record (simulating every possible crash point,
byte by byte) and confirm replay recovers exactly the complete records and
nothing else.

**Live (`cmd/lsmdb-cli`)** -- an actual subprocess you can `kill -9` mid-write:

```bash
go build -o bin/lsmdb-cli ./cmd/lsmdb-cli

./bin/lsmdb-cli write /tmp/demo.wal 5000000 &
PID=$!
sleep 0.3
kill -9 $PID        # simulate a hard crash, no graceful shutdown

./bin/lsmdb-cli replay /tmp/demo.wal
# -> recovered N complete records
# -> last recovered key: key-0000XXXX
```

Run it a few times -- the exact record count recovered will vary by a few hundred
depending on timing, but it should always be a clean prefix of what was written,
never a record beyond what was actually durable, and never a panic on the
truncated tail.

## Running tests

```bash
go test ./...
```
